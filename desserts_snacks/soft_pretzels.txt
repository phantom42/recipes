Original Recipe: http://www.bestyummyrecipes.com/homemade-soft-pretzels/

Ingredients:

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 1/2 tsp dried yeast (1 package)
- 1 cup warm water

Directions:

First, combine warm water, sugar and instant dried yeast in a small bowl. 

Cover and let sit for five minutes, until the mixture is frothy. 

Meanwhile, combine flour and salt in your electric mixer bowl. 

Once your yeast mixture is frothy, add it to the flour and mix until a soft dough forms. 

Then, using the dough hook attachment, knead for five minutes. 

Form the dough into a ball and place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise for 30 â€“ 40 minutes.

Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into eight equal pieces. P

reheat your oven to 400 deg F and line your baking sheets with parchment paper (or just grease them). 

In a small bowl, combine warm water and baking soda. On a greased surface, make your pretzels. 

Dip each pretzel into the baking soda and water mixture, then place them onto your prepared baking sheets and cover them, let rise for another 10 minutes.

Bake the pretzels for about 10 minutes, until they are golden brown on top. 

Once they are done, brush them with melted butter and sprinkle them with salt.
