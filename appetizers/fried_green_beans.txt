Fried Green Beans

Original Recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/almost-famous-green-bean-fries-recipe.html

Ingredients:

- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 pound green beans, trimmed
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 cup instant flour (such as Wondra)
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder teaspoon garlic powder
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying

Directions:

Fill a large bowl with ice water. Bring the broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. 

Add the green beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. 

Remove the beans with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking. 

Let cool in the water, then drain and pat dry.

Whisk the egg and milk in a shallow bowl. Put 1/2 cup flour in another shallow bowl. 

Combine the breadcrumbs, the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste in another bowl.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the green beans in the flour and shake off the excess. 

One at a time, dip the beans in the egg mixture, dredge in the breadcrumb mixture and lay on the prepared baking sheet. 

Freeze until the coating is set, about 30 minutes.

Heat 3 inches oil in a deep pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. 

Fry the green beans in batches until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 

Transfer the beans with tongs or a skimmer to a rack or paper towels to drain. Serve with the dip.
