Fried Pickles

Original Recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/almost-famous-fried-pickles-recipe.html

Ingredients:

- Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 3/4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Kosher salt
- 2 cups sliced dill pickles, drained

Directions:

Heat 1 inch peanut oil in a pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. 

Meanwhile, whisk the flour, Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl until smooth. 

Spread the pickles on paper towels and pat dry.

Add half of the pickles to the batter and toss to coat. 

Remove from the batter using a slotted spoon, letting the excess drip off, and add to the oil one at a time. 

Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 

Return the oil to 375 degrees F and repeat with the remaining pickles and batter. 

Serve immediately with the prepared sauce.
