Original Recipe: http://iowagirleats.com/2013/10/28/chicken-bacon-and-artichoke-pasta-with-creamy-garlic-sauce/

Ingedients:

2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 Tablespoons butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup flour
1-1/2 cups milk (I used 2%)
1-1/2 cups chicken broth
salt and pepper
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:

Melt butter in extra virgin olive oil in a skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic then saute for 30 seconds. Sprinkle in flour then whisk until smooth and cook for 1 minute. Slowly stream in milk and chicken broth, whisking to avoid lumps. Season with salt and pepper then switch to a wooden spoon and stir until thick and bubbly, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat then stir in parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.
