-1 large onion, peeled and chopped
-2 heads garlic, peeled and chopped fine
-1 and 1/2 cups grated horseradish

-Honey (to taste)

Directions:

Place all ingredients into  a LARGE mason  jar, pack down slightly, and pour apple cider vinegar on top.  Give the jar a little shake to remove any air bubbles.  Cover with tight-fitting lid.
    
Place into a dark, cool place for at least 2 weeks, a month is better.  Carefully strain out herbs, add honey to sweeten it slightly, and bottle your tonic.  Discard the strained ingredients OR try adding them to a stir fry.

Be careful when handling these ingredients as they can be irritating to hands and eyes.
