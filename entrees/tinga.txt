Tinga

Original Recipe: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1u6kg2/what_are_some_meals_that_are_simple_to_make_but/cef31iy

Ingredients:

2-3 smooked chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, depending on how hot you want it (Can costs $1)
3 Roma tomatoes grilled on a grill or pan until its soft.
3-4 cloves of garlic
5 dried California Chiles, boiled in water until soft (sold in the Mexican section)


Directions:

To make the sauce, you'll combine all ingredients minus the water the chiles are boiled in. 

Blend them and add some of the chile water until the sauce coats the spoon thickly. 

Then, shred thick pieces of chicken (I use roasted chicken from Vons) and add them into the sauce in a large pan. 

Cut a whole onion in thin slices and add to the pan and cook on high until a boil is reached then cook on low until the onions are translucent. 

Add Salt to taste.

Tinga is usually eaten on top of Tostadas with any of the following things on top: Lettuce, Cotija cheese, avocado slices, sour cream. My mother usually served it with avocado and some cotija cheese (it's sort of like Permasian cheese but not as tangy) with tostadas, rice, and beans on the side.

You can use tinga as a filling for enchiladas, burritos, empanadas, quesadillas and many more things.
