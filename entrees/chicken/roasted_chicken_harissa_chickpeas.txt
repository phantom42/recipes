Ingredients: 

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste

- 1/4 cup harissa paste
- 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425°F. 

Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. 

Season chicken with salt and pepper. 

Working in 2 batches, cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings from pan. 

Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. 

Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until beginning to darken, about 1 minute. 

Add chickpeas, harissa, and broth; bring to a simmer.

Nestle chicken, skin side up, in chickpeas; transfer skillet to oven. 

Roast until chicken is cooked through, 20–25 minutes. 

Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.
