Chicken Fingers

Original Recipe: http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/05/quickie-homemade-chicken-strips/

Ingredients:

-1 package Chicken Breasts, Cut Into Strips (sometimes Called "tenders" Or "strips")
-Buttermilk
-Franks Hot Sauce (optional)
-1-1/2 cup Flour
-2/3 tbsp baking powder
-2 teaspoons of seasoning (see below)
-Vegetable Oil
-sea salt to taste

Seasoning mix recipe:
-2 teaspoons paprika
-2 tablespoons black pepper
-1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 
Directions:

Start by rinsing and drying your chicken strips. Place chicken strips in a bowl.

If using hot sauce, cover chicken with hot sauce. 

Pour over enough buttermilk to cover chicken. Allow to sit for 15 to 20 minutes (or longer if you’d like).

In another bowl combine about 1 ½ cups flour, 2/3 tbsp baking powder, and 2 to 3 teaspoons of seasoning mix. Mix this together well. Next, add about ¼ to ½ cup of buttermilk into the flour mixture and stir lightly with a fork as you add it.

Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-low to medium heat.

Remove a few of the buttermilk-soaked strips and place them in the flour mixture, turning them over to coat them thoroughly. Place them on a plate. Continue coating chicken strips until they are all ready to cook.

When the oil is sufficiently heated, begin cooking the strips a few at a time. Cook them for about about 2 minutes per side depending on thickness. When golden and crispy, remove them to a paper towel-lined plate.

While still hot, season with sea salt to taste.

Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Yum!
