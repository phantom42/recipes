Green curry chicken with zucchini

Recipe provided by Hannah Knudsen 

Recipe: 

2 medium zucchini, cut in half lengthwise then crosswise (1/2 slices) 
Optional—a small Asian egglplant, cut the same way 
if you have one 1 medium onion, chopped 
1 can coconut milk 
2-3 TBSP green curry paste (I always use Maesri brand) 
1 lb boneless chicken breasts or thighs (or a mix), cut into bite-sized pieces 
1 ½ cups chicken broth 
2 TBSP fish sauce 
1 TBSP light brown sugar 
optional—1-2 TBSP cornstarch and a handful of basil leaves to garnish at the end 

Directions:

In a heavy skillet, bring half of the can of coconut milk to a gentle boil over medium-high heat; cook 2-3 minutes (should thicken a little and smell good). 

Add the curry paste, stirring til it dissolves and cook about 2 minutes. 

Add the chicken, tossing to coat and let it cook for about 2 minutes. 

Then it’s pretty much everything else goes in (except the basil & cornstarch if using): Add the rest of the coconut milk, chicken broth, zucchini, eggplant, onion, fish sauce, brown sugar. Bring it to a boil. 

Reduce heat to a “lively simmer,” cover, and cook 8-10 minutes, giving it a stir a few times. You want it to cook til the chicken is done & you like the texture of the zucchini. 

I think it’s a pretty thin curry sauce and like it a little thicker—so I will put the cornstarch in a small bowl, ladle in a bit of sauce, stir til the cornstarch dissolves, and dump that into the mix. 

Cook another minute or two til you like the thickness of the sauce. Garnish with basil if you have it.
