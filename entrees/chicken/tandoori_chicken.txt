Original Recipe: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1u6kg2/what_are_some_meals_that_are_simple_to_make_but/cefbilu

Ingredients:
 
 2 lbs. chicken, cubed 
 1 cup plain yogurt 
 Juice of 1 lemon 
 2 teaspoons curry powder 
 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
 1 teaspoon fresh ginger (I use ground ginger, still tasty) 
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 1 Tablespoon olive oil 
 1/2 onion, sliced 
 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, minced 
 2 cups cooked white rice

Directions:

Combine yogurt, lemon juice, and spices. 

Place chicken and sauce in a ziplock bag and stick it in the fridge for a while (at least a few hours, but the longer it marinates, the better it tastes). 

Heat olive oil in a pan, cook onions til translucent. 

Add chicken and cook thoroughly. 

Serve atop a bed of rice and sprinkle with cilantro.
