Original Recipe: http://rasamalaysia.com/salt-and-pepper-chicken-recipe/2/

Ingredients:

-1 chicken breast, about 8-10 oz, cut into bite-size cubes/pieces
-2 tbs soy sauce
-3 tbs 5-spice powder
-1/2 tbs rice wine or sake
-1/8 tsp black pepper powder
-1 1/4 tsp sugar
-1 egg yolk
-1/6 tsp salt (optional)
-A bunch of Thai basil leaves
-1 cup potato starch or corn flour
-Oil for deep-frying

Method:

Marinate the chicken with the seasonings except salt including the egg yolk for 2 hours in the fridge. When ready to deep-fry, put 1 cup of potato starch or corn flour on a flat plate. Add the chicken to the flour and coat evenly. Heat up a wok or deep-fryer with oil and deep fry the chicken pieces until they turn golden brown. Transfer the fried chicken out on a plate lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.

Deep fry the basil leaves until crispy and garnish on top of the fried chicken. 

Season with additional salt 

Serve immediately.
