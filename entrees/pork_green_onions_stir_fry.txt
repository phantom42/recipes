Pork Stir Fry with Green Onion

Original Recipe: http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/pork_stir_fry_with_green_onion/

Ingredients:

1 pound pork loin or boneless pork chops
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon corn starch
4 Tbsp peanut oil or other high smoke point oil (canola, rice bran, or grape seed)
5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
8-12 scallions/green onions, sliced diagonally into 1 to 2-inch pieces, green and white parts included
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)


Directions:

Pork chops tend to come in thicknesses either around 1/2 inch thick or an inch thick. If you are working with a thick boneless pork chop, start by slicing it into two thin layers, horizontally.  If starting with pork loin, cut slices 1/2 inch thick.  Put the slices under some plastic wrap or wax paper and pound them thin with a rubber mallet, meat mallet or even an empty wine bottle. This will help tenderize the meat. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the pork against the grain into thin strips, about 1 1/2 inches long.

Put the soy sauce, sugar, and corn starch into a large bowl and whisk to combine.  Add the pork strips to the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat completely. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.

Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large saut√© pan on high heat. When the oil is hot (shimmering but not smoking) add the garlic slices and stir-fry until they begin to turn brown at the edges, about 30 seconds. Add the pork strips and stir-fry until the pork changes color, about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.

Add the sliced green onions and continue to stir-fry for another minute, or until the green onions wilt. Turn off the heat and stir in the sesame oil, if using.

Serve immediately. Serve alone, or with rice.
