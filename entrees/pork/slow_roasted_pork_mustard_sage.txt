Slow-Roasted Pork with Mustard and Sage

Original Recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Slow-Roasted-Pork-Shoulder-with-Mustard-and-Sage-51224010

Ingredients:

	1 skinless, bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt; 5–6 pounds)
	Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
	1/2 cup Dijon mustard
	1/4 cup finely chopped fresh sage
	2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh marjoram
	4 garlic cloves, finely chopped


Directions:

Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 325°F. 

Season pork with salt and pepper. 

Mix mustard, sage, marjoram, and garlic in a small bowl.

Spread all over pork, working it into all the crevices.

Place pork, fat side up, on a rack set inside a roasting pan and roast, basting with pan juices about every hour and tenting with foil if pork browns too quickly, until pork is well browned and very tender, 5–6 hours (depending on size of pork shoulder).

Let pork rest at least 10 minutes before serving (the meat should pull apart easily).
