Original Recipe: http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2011/11/pork-roast-with-apples-and-onions/

Ingredients:

Pork
-3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
-1 whole Pork Shoulder Roast (also Called Pork Butt)
-Salt And Pepper, to taste
-4 cups Apple Juice
-1 cup Beef Stock
-3 whole Apples, Cored And Cut Into Wedges
-3 whole Medium Onions, Sliced
-1 whole Bay Leaf

Wild Rice
-2-1/2 cups Wild Rice
-4 cups Water
-3 cups Chicken Stock
-1/2 stick 4 Tablespoons Butter
-1/2 cup Chopped Pecans

Directions:

OPTIONAL: Saute onions until brown. (Or you may just add them raw to the roast.)

To make the pork roast, heat olive oil in a large pot over high heat. 

Salt and pepper pork roast, then sear on all sides to give it some color. 

Reduce heat to low. 

Add apple juice, apple slices, onions, and bay leaf. 

Cover and simmer for 3 hours. (Or you may place in a 300 degree oven if you prefer.)

Toward the end of the cooking time, make the rice: melt butter in a medium saucepan. 

Add pecans and saute for a couple of minutes. 

Add wild rice and liquid, then bring to a boil. 

Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until all liquid is cooked out.

When the roast is done, remove the roast, apples, and onions to a platter. 

Raise heat to medium-high (to high) and boil liquid, reducing it until thick and rich.

Spoon thick sauce over the roast, then cut the roast into slices. 

Serve with apples, onions, and wild rice.

(Note: add fresh thyme or rosemary to the roast before cooking if you have it on hand!)
