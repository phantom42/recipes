-1/2 onion, chopped
-1 teaspoon ground black pepper
-2 1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the ground beef and the onion and saute for 10 minutes, or until meat is browned and onion is tender. Drain grease, if desired. Work in batches (high fat/low fat and half onions) if necessary.

Add the ground black pepper, garlic salt, tomato sauce, salsa, chili seasoning mix and kidney beans. Mix well, reduce heat to low and simmer for at least an hour. Check seasoning at 45 minutes.
