Ingredients:

1 lb ground beef
Ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella
Box of jumbo shells
Spices

Directions:

Once you brown the ground beef dump in a small green can thing of parm, fill it up with mozzarella and then add in ricotta to taste. 

Mix by hand, add seasoning (I usually add oregano, garlic powder, cilantro, salt and Italian seasoning) then stuff the shells by hand. 

Pour spaghetti sauce on top, then throw more shredded mozzarella on top of the shells and bake at 350 till the cheese is bubbly.
