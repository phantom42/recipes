Italian Sausage Soup

Original Recipe: http://community.livejournal.com/cooking/7007682.html

-1 package hot sausages (5 links)
-1 shallot (2 if they are small or half an onion)
-2 clove garlic
-1 can dice tomatoes with basil oregano and garlic
-1 can white beans
-2 cups chopped fresh baby spinach
-1/2-3/4 cup of mini pasta shells
-28 oz beef stock (low salt)

Directions: 

Remove sausage from casing. Crumble and brown on bottom of stock pot or large pot. No oil is needed - the sausage will release its own.

Remove sausage from pot. Set aside. Leave renderings.

Add 1/2 tbsp butter and sautee shallots and garlic.

Add beef stock, boil and lower to simmer.

Add the tomatoes beans, and meat back in as well as the mini shells, cover and let it simmer until the shells were done (you can also pre cook the shells and just add them in)
remove from the heat stir in the spinach replace the lid for 5 min (this cooks the spinach just enough)
