Italian Sausage Soup

Original Recipe: http://community.livejournal.com/cooking/7007682.html

-2 mild italian sausages
-2 hot italian sausages
-1 shallot (2 if they are small or half an onion)
-1 clove garlic
-1 can dice tomatoes with basil oregano and garlic
-1 can white beans
-2 cups chopped fresh baby spinach
-1/2-3/4 cup of mini pasta shells
-28 oz beef stock (low salt)

I took the sausages out of their casings, crumbled and browned them up in the stock pot (or dutch oven if you have one )
Took that out to drain
In the sausage renderings with just a touch of butter then I sauteed the shallots and garlic
Once that was done I put in the beef stock and brought it to a simmer
Added the tomatoes beans, and meat back in as well as the mini shells, cover and let it simmer until the shells were done (you can also pre cook the shells and just add them in)
remove from the heat stir in the spinach replace the lid for 5 min (this cooks the spinach just enough)
