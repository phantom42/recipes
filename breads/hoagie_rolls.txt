Super Soft 'n Chewy Hoagie Rolls

Original Recipe: http://www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/2012/07/02/super-soft-n-chewy-hoagie-rolls/

Ingredients:

-4 cups bread flour
-1 3/8 cups warm water (110-115F degrees) 3/8 cup is equal to 6 Tbl :)
-2 Tbl sugar
-1 Tbl active dry yeast
-1 tsp salt
-3 Tbl cold butter, cubed


Directions:

Add the yeast, sugar and 3/8 cup warm water in a bowl of a stand mixer.

Using a whisk or spoon, mix and set aside for 5-10 minutes or until the yeast has bubbled quite a bit.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (this would be the same bowl your yeast mixture is in) add in the flour and remaining cup of water. Start off on low.

Mix for 4 minutes.

Add in the salt and mix for 5-6 minutes until the dough is slack (See note). At this point your mixer should be at medium speed.

Add in the butter and mix for 1-3 minutes or until the dough comes back together.

Remove from bowl and transfer to a greased, covered bowl until doubled in size. ~1 hour.

Divide into 8 pieces and shape. I would advise using as little flour as possible when shaping these. The more flour you add, the tougher the hoagies will be.

Transfer to a sprayed, parchment lined tray and cover.

Allow to rise again. ~30-45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 and bake for 16-23 minutes or until golden brown.

Allow to cool before cutting with a quality bread knife ( Sani-Safe S162-8SC-PCP 8" Scalloped Bread Knife with Polypropylene Handle Pan )
