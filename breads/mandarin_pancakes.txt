Mandarin Pancakes

Original Recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mu-shu-pork-recipe.html

Ingredients:

- 2 cups sifted flour
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 1 to 2 tablespoons sesame oil


Directions:

Place flour in a medium bowl, making a well in the center. 

Pour in the boiling water, and use a wooden spoon or chopsticks to mix until a soft dough is formed. 

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough gently until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. 

Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 20 minutes.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a log, 16 inches long. 

Cut the log crosswise into 1 inch pieces, shape each piece into a ball, then use your hands to flatten each ball into a pancake. 

Brush the tops of the pancakes lightly with the sesame oil. 

Then, place one pancake on top of a second pancake, oiled sides together, so that there are 8 pairs. 

With a rolling pin, flatten each pair into a 6 inch circle. (A tortilla press also works well for this.) 

Cover the pancakes with a damp towel to rest.

Heat an ungreased, nonstick skillet over medium heat. 

Cook the pancakes, one at a time, turning them once as they puff and little bubbles appear on the surface, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. 

As each pancake is finished, remove from pan and gently separate the halves into 2 pancakes while still hot. 

Stack cooked pancakes on a plate while cooking the remaining pancakes.

Serve pancakes while still warm with Mu Shu Pork. Or, pancakes may be prepared up to 1 day in advance, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated. 

Pancakes may also be frozen. Reheat them by steaming for 5 minutes, or warming them in a 350 degree F oven, wrapped in foil, for 10 minutes.

Yield: 16 pancakes
