Paremsan Baked Potato Halves

Original Recipe: http://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/2012/03/parmesan-baked-potato-halves.html

Ingredients:

6 small potatoes, scrubbed and cut in half
1/4 cup butter
grated parmesan cheese
garlic powder
other seasonings (to personal preference)

Directions:

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

Melt butter and pour into a 9x13 inch pan and spread evenly across the bottom. 

Generously sprinkle parmesan cheese and lightly sprinkle other seasonings all over the butter. 

Place potato halves face down on the butter and seasonings. 

Place in preheated oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. 

Cool for at least a FULL 5 minutes before removing from the pan, otherwise the parmesan crust won't stick to the potato. 

Serve on a plate with a side of sour cream for dipping.
