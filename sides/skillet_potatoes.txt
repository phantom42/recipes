Skillet Potatoes

Original Recipe: http://jamiecooksitup.net/2013/05/simple-skillet-breakfast-potatoes/

Ingredients:

-6-7 russet potatoes (about 5 cups chopped)
-4 T butter
-1 tsp smoked paprika
-1/2 T seasoned salt (I use Lawry's)
-salt and pepper

Directions:

Find yourself 7-8 russest potatoes. Get them into your sink and scrub them clean. 

With a sharp knife cut the potato into 1/2 inch strips. Turn the slices over so the skin side is up. Cut 4-5 more half-inch slices. 

Then starting at the bottom of the stack cut half-inch slices going up to the top. Repeat with the other potatoes. 

Heat a deep skillet up over medium high heat. Add 4 tablespoons of butter to the pan. Allow it to melt down. 

Add your potatoes and give them a nice stir or two so that all of the potatoes have some butter on them. 

Add 1/2 teaspoon (or more if you love it like me) smoked paprika. 

Toss in 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt and a generous helping of salt and pepper. 

Give everything a good stir, making sure the seasonings are distributed evenly. 

Cover the pan and let the potatoes cook through. Should take about 15 minutes. Y

ou'll want to check on them several times to be sure they aren't burning. Make sure to stir them each time you check on them. 

When the potatoes are soft on the inside remove the pan from the heat. 

Taste them and add more salt and pepper to your liking.
